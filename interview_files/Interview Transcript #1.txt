Juan (Interviewer): Hi Santiago. How’s it going? Well, I wanted to interview you.

Santiago (Interviewee): Oh, okay, okay.

Juan: So, first a few quick questions. How old are you?

Santiago: Well, 20 years old.

Juan: And are you currently in a relationship?

Santiago: No.

Juan: What degree are you studying?

Santiago: What was it? Systems engineering.

Juan: What semester are you in?

Santiago: Around seventh.

Juan: Okay, that’s good. So, how do you usually spend your free time between classes, your breaks?

Santiago: Well, usually, when I feel like doing things, I get ahead on assignments and tasks. If not, and I’m really tired from university, maybe I work on a video game or something like that.

Juan: A video game? And don’t you rest? Don’t you do something different when you don’t want to do anything or don’t have anything university-related to do?

Santiago: Well, it also depends on the time of day we’re talking about. For example, I’ve had classes at eight in the morning, and I’m a student who doesn’t manage my time very well, so I usually arrive tired to class. There have been times when I’ve had to try to rest and sleep during those breaks.

Juan: And have you actually slept in any space at the university?

Santiago: Yes, usually I try to find the least crowded and most, in quotes, “comfortable” spot. I find that mainly in the library.

Juan: Yes, the ML one maybe, or which one?

Santiago: Yes, really that’s the only one I know, the ML one. On some blue chairs — well, yes, that’s what’s there.

Juan: Yes, yes, I know them. And what’s it like to sleep there? Comfortable, uncomfortable?

Santiago: Well, obviously it’s not a bed, but the university isn’t meant to have beds, so I think it does the job.

Juan: And have you ever thought about going to sleep somewhere else, like actually looking for a bed to sleep in, to be more comfortable during that time, maybe in longer breaks?

Santiago: Not really.

Juan: That’s fine. And have you looked for a private place for something else, not just to sleep?

Santiago: Not just to sleep, like what?

Juan: I don’t know, maybe to be comfortable somewhere to study, or just lie down and work from there or study from there. Like a room just for yourself.

Santiago: Honestly, it never crossed my mind. If I want to study, I have the university, the library, computer rooms, and for resting, I think the point of university isn’t to rest.

Juan: I totally understand that the point of university isn’t to rest, but let’s say that if at some point, like some people who pull all-nighters, you wanted to rest but still had class, then it’s about finding a balance. Because sometimes some rooms aren’t made for sleeping.

Santiago: Yes, I understand that could happen. Fortunately, it’s never happened to me; I’ve never had to pull an all-nighter. But I can see people who might look for that service.

Juan: And where have you seen people use it?

Santiago: Well, it would obviously have to be somewhere near the university. I once met someone from architecture, in an English class I took, who said they had to pull an all-nighter because they had a project due, then a three-hour break before a midterm.

Juan: Right, and then an exam without sleeping is brutal.

Santiago: Yes, they told me they would even pay for a place to sleep.

Juan: Do you know if there’s anywhere at the university, like a WhatsApp group or informal arrangements, to go to those spaces?

Santiago: No.

Juan: Have you had a partner in the last three months?

Santiago: Yes, the occasional partner here and there. Not currently, but yes, I have.

Juan: And when you want a private moment with that person, have you looked for a private place?

Santiago: Yes, but in the current environment, it’s hard to find places for that. I’ve tried motels or something similar, but it’s difficult.

Juan: Have you ever used WhatsApp groups, friends, or something like that to get one?

Santiago: Yes, I’ve heard the university has a group called Motel Andes. That’s basically what it’s about — people offering rooms. But it’s complicated because the offer comes when they can, not when you need it.

Juan: So the problem is that you want to reserve, but there’s no room available when you need it.

Santiago: Exactly.

Juan: What would make the process easier for you?

Santiago: As I said, the problem is when I want to get something, I’d like to be able to find that offer right then. So I think I’d like some kind of website where I could see these things, or an app that lets me see what’s available at the moment. That would make things much easier.

Juan: And would you be willing to pay for it?

Santiago: Of course. No one is going to rent you a room for free; it’s a service, and of course, I’d pay for it.

Juan: Okay, thank you very much, Santiago.

Santiago: You’re welcome, see you.
