José David (Interviewer): Do I have your permission to record the interview?
Valentina (Interviewee): Yes.

José David: What’s your age, major, and current semester?
Valentina: I’m 20 years old, I study Biomedical Engineering, and I’m in my sixth semester.

José David: How do you usually spend your free time between classes?
Valentina: Normally, at the beginning of the term I rest between classes, and towards the end I use the time to study or finish projects.

José David: Do you usually carry or need things you don’t use all the time, or sometimes lend/exchange things with classmates?
Valentina: Yes.

José David: Tell me about a recent occasion at the university when you needed a space or a specific resource, but it wasn’t available or was hard to get.
Valentina: Yes, with my study group we needed a book to prepare for an exam, but since the class is big, all the copies in the library were taken and we couldn’t get it.

José David: Have you ever wanted a place or a way to store, exchange, or borrow something temporarily? How was that experience?
Valentina: Yes, it has happened with objects or gym clothes, or even clothes I use after working out.

José David: If you had to choose, what factors would be key in deciding with whom or where to get what you need?
Valentina: For a space, comfort, quietness, and privacy; and for an object, price and maybe speed.

José David: When you need a quiet space or a specific object, what’s the first thing you do to get it?
Valentina: Normally, if it’s a space, I look around the university for free places; and if it’s an object, I write to friends or post in a group.

José David: Do you use social media, messaging groups, or word of mouth to find things or places? How has that worked for you?
Valentina: Yes, I mainly use WhatsApp, but it’s not very efficient because sometimes people don’t answer in time, they don’t have it, or it takes too long to meet up.

José David: What problems have you had coordinating with people to use something or meet in a place?
Valentina: As I just said, sometimes they don’t have what I need or they take too long to deliver it.

José David: Thinking about how you get what you need—whether spaces, objects, or help—would you say the current system is efficient? Why or why not?
Valentina: No, it’s not efficient because I don’t always get what I need or there aren’t always free spaces in the university.

José David: What would make it easier and faster for you to find what you’re looking for or the space you need?
Valentina: Maybe having a place or space that is always available and with the things I need.

José David: What would make you trust someone to lend you a space or an object?
Valentina: That they have reviews, pictures of the place or object, and also that I can confirm the person is a university student.

José David: If there were a safe and quick way to get what you need, would you use it? Why?
Valentina: Yes, I would use it because it would make my life and activities at the university easier.

José David: In the case of paying or giving something in return, what would you consider fair for the temporary use of a space or object?
Valentina: That the price is reasonable compared to the condition of the object or place.

José David: Is there anything else about your experience looking for things or places at the university that I haven’t asked and you think is important?
Valentina: No, not at the moment.

José David: Would you be interested in testing a prototype that makes these situations easier?
Valentina: Yes, I would like that.

José David: Thank you very much for your time.
Valentina: You’re welcome.
